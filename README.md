## Useful cargo commands

# cargo build

This command creates an executable file

# cargo run 

Compile the code and then run the resulting executable all in one command

# cargo new <project name> --bin 

The --bin argument passed to cargo new makes an executable application (often just called a binary) as opposed to a library.
